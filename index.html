			<!-- About -->
			<article id="about">
				<h2 class="major">About Us</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>We are more than just a business; we are a father and son, a family united by a shared passion for
					craftsmanship. In 2012, our company was born from the vision of embarking on our first joint
					project, allowing Graham to pass on his wealth of knowledge and experience through the art of
					converting a barn.<br> Since those beginnings, we've journeyed together, expanding our horizons to
					encompass numerous conversions, extensions, and renovations. Yet, no matter how far we venture, we
					remain firmly rooted in our heritage of traditional carpentry and joinery. It's where our heart
					lies, and it's the foundation of our enduring commitment to craftsmanship.</p>
				<h3 class="major">Graham Bond</h3>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/Graham.jpg"
						alt="Graham in his Cruck Framed barn conversion that he is converting as his forever home" /></span>
				<p>Graham's journey is one rich with hands-on experience and a relentless commitment to his craft. His
					story began as an apprentice boat builder in Diglis, Worcester. It was there that he honed his
					skills, learning the intricate art of crafting boats with precision and dedication.</p>
				<p>As his journey continued, Graham's passion led him to explore new horizons, and he transitioned his
					expertise to the world of kitchen fitting. It was during this phase that he began to envision the
					possibilities of combining traditional craftsmanship with modern living.</p>
				<p>With unwavering determination, Graham took a significant leap and founded his very first business,
					'Hand Built Traditional Furniture.' To say it was a success would be an understatement. The business
					thrived, becoming a testament to his skills and dedication.</p>
				<p>Yet, amidst all the achievements and accolades, Graham's heart remained deeply rooted in the craft
					itself. His true passion lies not only in creating exceptional pieces but also in imparting his vast
					knowledge and experience to the next generation of craftsmen.</p>
				<p>Today, within our family business, Graham's wisdom and dedication continue to inspire and shape the
					work we do. It's a journey that started with the construction of boats and evolved into the creation
					of timeless furniture, all the while instilling a sense of pride and craftsmanship that defines our
					family legacy.</p>
				<p>In the early '90s, Graham embarked on a transformative journey that would shape his career and
					passion for barn conversions. It all began when he caught the bug for these remarkable projects,
					thanks to the inspiration and guidance of a close friend. This newfound enthusiasm led him to
					undertake his very first barn conversion.</p>
				<p>With unwavering determination and a growing fascination for breathing life into these historical
					structures, Graham poured his heart and soul into that initial project. Little did he know that this
					endeavour would mark the beginning of a remarkable career in preserving the character and heritage
					of barns, turning them into beautiful, functional spaces.</p>
				<p>That early experience not only kindled Graham's love for barn conversions but also laid the
					foundation for the family business, where father and son now share their expertise, passing on the
					tradition of craftsmanship to future generations. It's a testament to the power of inspiration and
					the enduring allure of these magnificent structures.</p>
				<h3 class="major">Michael Bond</h3>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Michael's journey has been a remarkable fusion of military service and a deep-rooted family
					tradition. He embarked on his career in the military, but he never strayed far from the family's
					skill set. Michael's path led him to train as a carpenter joiner within the Royal Engineers. The
					skills he acquired in the military were transformative, teaching him to work under intense stress
					and pressure while remaining adaptable and resilient in the face of challenges.</p>
				<p>Among his greatest achievements was his unwavering dedication to offering his carpentry skills during
					relief efforts following Hurricanes Irma and Maria in the Caribbean. Michael played a pivotal role
					in restoring roofs to schools and power stations, ensuring that children could return to their
					classrooms and that the affected islands regained their power supply.</p>
				<p>In 2019 after nearly a decades service, Michael made the decision to leave the army in preparation
					for the birth of his daughter. Driven by a deep desire to learn and contribute to the family
					business. This choice was, in many ways, inevitable, as he had grown up surrounded by the
					transformation of barns and spent his summer holidays immersed in the world of Hand Built
					Traditional Furniture, where he took on various roles, from sweeping up to making teas and providing
					labor.</p>
				<p>Today, Michael works closely alongside Graham, who serves as his mentor and guide as he continues to
					develop and grow within the industry. With a keen interest in window restorations, Michael is
					rapidly honing his eye for historic buildings and barns. It's evident that he is on a path to carry
					forward the family legacy, and one day, he will assume the mantle of leadership in the family
					business, ensuring its continued success into the future.</p>
				<h3 class="major">The Team</h3>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Throughout the years, Graham and Michael have cultivated enduring friendships with local tradesmen,
					forming a close-knit team that stands behind Bond & Son Ltd. These skilled individuals are the
					backbone of our operations, and their expertise and dedication make everything we do possible.</p>
				<p>Among these invaluable partners are Chris Adams of Genetic Joinery and Lee Carbines of Carbines
					Restorations. Their collaboration and craftsmanship have been instrumental in our journey.
					Additionally, our team extends to include Max, Pete, Matthew, Luke and a host of other individuals
					and companies whose contributions are equally significant. While there are too many to mention
					individually, each one plays a vital role in the success of our endeavors.</p>
				<p>At Bond & Son Ltd, we believe that strong relationships with our peers and partners are the
					cornerstone of our accomplishments. We are deeply grateful for the collaborative spirit that drives
					us forward, and we look forward to many more years of shared achievements and mutual support.</p>
